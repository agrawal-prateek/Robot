Python Samples for the Google Assistant gRPC API
================================================

This repository contains a reference sample for the ``google-assistant-grpc`` Python package_.

It implements the following features:

- Triggering a conversation using a key press
- Audio recording of user queries (single or multiple consecutive queries)
- Playback of the Assistant response
- Conversation state management
- Volume control

.. _package: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/google-assistant-grpc

Prerequisites
-------------

- `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ (>= 3.4 recommended)
- A `Google API Console Project <https://console.developers.google.com>`_
- A `Google account <https://myaccount.google.com/>`_

Setup
-----

- Install Python 3

    - Ubuntu/Debian GNU/Linux::

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install python3 python3-venv

    - `MacOSX, Windows, Other <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_

- Create a new virtual environment (recommended)::

    python3 -m venv env
    env/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    source env/bin/activate

Authorization
-------------

- Follow `the steps to configure the project and the Google account <https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/develop/grpc/config-dev-project-and-account>`_.

- Download the ``client_secret_XXXXX.json`` file from the `Google API Console Project credentials section <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials>`_ in the current directory.

- Generate credentials using ``google-oauth-tool``::

    pip install --upgrade google-auth-oauthlib[tool]
    google-oauthlib-tool --client-secrets client_secret_XXXXX.json --scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/assistant-sdk-prototype --save --headless

Run the samples
---------------

- Install the sample dependencies::

    sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev
    pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

-  Verify audio setup::

    # Record a 5 sec sample and play it back
    python -m audio_helpers

- Register or overwrite the device model and device instance with the supported traits::

    python -m devicetool register --model 'my-model-identifier' \
                                  --type LIGHT --trait action.devices.traits.OnOff \
                                  --manufacturer 'Assistant SDK developer' \
                                  --product-name 'Assistant SDK light' \
                                  --description 'Assistant SDK light device' \
                                  --device 'my-device-identifier' \
                                  --nickname 'My Assistant Light'

*Note: The device model identifier must be globally unique, and device instance identifier must be unique within the Google Developer Project associated with the device.*

- Run the push to talk sample. The sample records a voice query after a key press and plays back the Google Assistant's answer::

    python -m pushtotalk --device-id 'my-device-identifier'

- Try some Google Assistant voice query like "What time is it?" or "Who am I?".

- Try a device action query like "Turn <nickname / model product name> on".

- Run in verbose mode to see the gRPC communication with the Google Assistant API::

    python -m pushtotalk --device-id 'my-device-identifier' -v

- Send a pre-recorded request to the Assistant::

    python -m pushtotalk --device-id 'my-device-identifier' -i in.wav

- Save the Assistant response to a file::

    python -m pushtotalk --device-id 'my-device-identifier' -o out.wav

Troubleshooting
---------------

- Verify ALSA setup::

    # Play a test sound
    speaker-test -t wav

    # Record and play back some audio using ALSA command-line tools
    arecord --format=S16_LE --duration=5 --rate=16000 --file-type=raw out.raw
    aplay --format=S16_LE --rate=16000 --file-type=raw out.raw

- If Assistant audio is choppy, try adjusting the sound device's block size::

    # If using a USB speaker or dedicated soundcard, set block size to "0"
    # to automatically adjust the buffer size
    python -m audio_helpers --audio-block-size=0

    # If using the line-out 3.5mm audio jack on the device, set block size
    # to a value larger than the `ConverseResponse` audio payload size
    python -m audio_helpers --audio-block-size=3200

    # Run the Assistant sample using the best block size value found above
    python -m pushtotalk --audio-block-size=value

- If Assistant audio is truncated, try adjusting the sound device's flush size::

    # Set flush size to a value larger than the audio block size. You can
    # run the sample using the --audio-flush-size flag as well.
    python -m audio_helpers --audio-block-size=3200 --audio-flush-size=6400
